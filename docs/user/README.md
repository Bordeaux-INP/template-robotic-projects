# 📖 User documentation

## ⁉️ Purpose of this documentation

This documentation is intended to the **end users** of your work.
They are usually engineering-agnostic and are not able to understand mecatronics or software engineering.
Imagine that you are giving instructions to your little bro. 


## ⁉️ What is expected here

The user documentation must explain how to **start** your project and how to use each feature, most of the time without technical terms.
Inspire from the User Manual of your washing machine. Add screenshots and pictures when relevant for your end users.
